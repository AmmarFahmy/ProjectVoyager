# Project Voyager
A new and universal file manager built for the way you work, on any platform. (Win, Mac, Linux)

# So what does it do?
Voyager can navigate through your local filesystem and open any file in its default program. That's... pretty much it right now. I am in the process of wrapping up basic file movement functions. (cut, copy, paste) This should be done soon. therefore, Voyager is not a fully-featured or official file "manager" as of yet. I work and go to high school right now so this is basically my personal project. I hope you can understand üòÅ

**Final Words**

If you wish to contribute to Voyager, feel free to do so. I've recently made the code public so anyone can read it or test it. If I manage to get back to you on an issue or pull request, consider yourself lucky. Git is something I'm still learning, and being a teenager still in high school, I never have as much time as I need. Thank you for taking the time to check this out!
