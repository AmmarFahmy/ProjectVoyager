# Project Voyager
A new and universal file manager built for the way you work, on any platform. (Win, Mac, Linux)

***
**Sticky Note: (4/14 - 5/1)**
The next two or so weeks of Voyager's development are going into bug squashing and prepping for a May 1st release. Any issues must be filed before the 27th. The AP Computer Science deadline is the 1st for my school. Thanks for your consideration. ‚úåüòÅ

**So what does it do?**

Voyager can navigate through your local filesystem and open any file in its default program. It can use an internal clipboard to cut, copy and paste files to new locations. You can also remove files. The entire program works the same exact way on any platform, as long as all dependencies are met and the core Node.js APIs work. The UI is stylish and the engine is designed to be themed. Known platform inconsistencies are listed in the 'Known Issues' section of this article.

### Building From Source
***

**Linux Installer(Beta) By Luis Vervaet**

To Install Voyager on Linux, you need the following prerequisites installed:

* wget

Firstly download and bash run:
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=19s1TXvEWpAYPoxExxhs9vOOmWCaNFzjt

Then, run:

```
voyager
```

Afterwards, follow the required steps.

Once installation is complete, re-run:

```
voyager
```
***

**Non Linux Machines, or if the integrated installer fails**

To build the current version of Project Voyager, make sure you have these prerequisites installed via your platform's command line:

* node/npm
* git
* Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools (If you want to test fluent design features)

Then, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/TotalChris/ProjectVoyager.git
```

Next, cd into 'ProjectVoyager' and run:

```
npm i
```

Optionally, if you want to test fluent design features found in the Fluent-UI-Tools.js script (Windows only), run:

```
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
npm install windows-registry
```

After dependencies have been installed, run Voyager with:

```
npm start
```

***
**Usage**

You can exit the window at any time by normal means, including from the command line itself (Ctrl + C), should the window freeze or the controls break.

***
**Known Issues**

- Moving directories has not been implemented.
- Moving or deleting large files will cause hang which may prompt the user to attempt killing the task. The solution is to rewrite the dumpItems() function to run in a seperate background process, or as an asynchronous process, and report to the user that the file is on its way.
- Moving over a file which has a conflicting name with a pre-existing file will throw EBUSY. If the    file was cut, the result is worse... The file will be deleted from its previous location but not transfer to the new one.
- The top panel cannot be pinned and has no other functions besides theme toggling.
- Theme settings are not saved in any way and always default to Dark Matte upon opening.

**Final Words**

If you wish to contribute to Voyager, feel free to do so. I've recently made the code public so anyone can read it or test it. If I manage to get back to you on an issue or pull request, consider yourself lucky. Git is something I'm still learning, and being a teenager still in high school, I never have as much time as I need. Thank you for taking the time to check this out!
